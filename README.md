Proof of Burn Python Base 58 Implementation Check
===================


###Free Proof of Burn Addresses 

[Coin Burn](http://coinburn.com) is completely free, and has produced burn addresses from 1 - 9, A - Z and a - z for cryptocurrency or altcoins that are descended from bitcoin (99.9%). The following addresses are generated by use of a Python Base58 and Base58Check implementation template.

### A cryptocurrency "Burn Address"

"Proof of Burn" addresses are primarily used by developers of a cryptocurrency that desire to reduce the total amount of available coins.

A full list is available at [coinburn.com](http;//coinburn.com/). 

Alternatively use the Python Base58 and Base58Check implementation template, and create personalised Base 58 addresses.
